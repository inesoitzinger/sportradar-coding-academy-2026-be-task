AI usage declaration

During this assignment I used ChatGPT (GPT-5) continuously as a support tool.

In practice this means:
- I did not sit fully alone in a vacuum
- I used AI the same way I would normally use a senior engineer as a sparring partner
- sometimes I asked for code examples or best practice patterns
- in some cases I partially used or adapted small code fragments that AI suggested → but I always understood, modified and integrated them consciously

I remained the owner of the code.

The architectural choices, domain model, REST design, exception strategy, DTO boundaries and final implementation decisions are mine.

What AI specifically helped with
- thinking through domain modeling (Sport → League → Team → Match)
- clarifying where domain rules should live (aggregate vs service vs controller)
- discussing REST resource naming vs filtering
- deciding when data should return null vs numeric probability
- unblocking myself when I hit annoying error messages (Spring injection, DTO type issues)
- improving the README to be easier to consume for a reviewer
- discussing how to phrase documentation to make the project more “reviewable”

What AI did not do
- AI never generated the full project
- AI never dumped a one-shot solution
- AI never replaced my implementation
- AI never owned any file / feature end-to-end

If AI suggested something, it entered the project only after I:
- understood it
- evaluated it
- adapted it to my structure

Why I believe this usage is legitimate

Software engineering is not just “typing code”.

This challenge tested:
- domain thinking
- modelling
- API design
- correctness
- clarity
- boundary decisions

AI supported me in thinking – not in outsourcing.

I view this as equivalent to having a senior engineer on call for feedback.

I wrote, read, edited, integrated and debugged every final line.
